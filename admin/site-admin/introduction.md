# Introduction

The **Site Admin** interface allows you to manage your Stoplight settings, including:

- [Configure your Stoplight installation](general.md) <!-- QUERY: does this need rephrasing to cover SaaS users? -->
- [View your organization's users](people.md) <!-- QUERY: is organization the right word? Am basing this off organizations in Next -->
- [Integrate external services](external-services.md)
- [Add and analyze projects](projects.md)

<!-- TODO: fix the links above once I know where they will end up in the Stoplight Next project -->
