# Manage projects

Access **Projects** from the Stoplight dashboard by selecting:

**admin** > **Site Admin** > **Projects**

You can view a list of projects and search for an individual project.

<!-- QUERY: at present, the UI says "Projects are synced from external services". Will there be no way to create a project from scratch in Stoplight Dojo? -->
