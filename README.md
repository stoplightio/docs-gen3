# Documentation for Stoplight Dojo

## The docs project

The current site is build using Stoplight Next. Refer to the [Confluence Space](https://stoplightio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/D/overview) for links and project info. Refer to the [JIRA project](https://stoplightio.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=25&projectKey=DOC&selectedIssue=DOC-49) for issues and task tracking.

The master branch is live.

## Style and tone - quickstart

More info [here](https://stoplightio.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/D/pages/115802134/Style+and+tone).

Follow the guidance from the Stoplight Next style guide for corporate tone.

### Style rules

- Headings are sentence case.
- Use **bold** for UI elements.
- Use $variable_name in commands to indicate placeholders.
- Match trademark branding for Stoplight and other software.

### Writing tips

- Avoid passive voice.
- Avoid words like "simply", or phrases such as "this is a quick procedure". The documentation should not make value claims, especially ones that may further irritate already-frustrated users.
